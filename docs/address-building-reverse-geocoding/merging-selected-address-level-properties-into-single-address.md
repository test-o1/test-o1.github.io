# 5. Merging Selected Address Level Properties Into Single Address

After selecting our properties specialized by our selected third-party reverse geocode provider, we can use our address in file and folder names. To merge address levels, `-` character is used as default.

Example merged address may used in file/folder names: `Turkey-Ankara-Çankaya-Mebusevleri-Anıtkabir`

You may change default separator (`-`) via [settings](/docs/settings) command with a setting key `AddressSeparator`
