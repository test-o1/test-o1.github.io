  --help                            Display this help screen.

  --version                         Display version information.

NOTES:
- Instead of option names (for ex: DateTimeWithMinutes), you may use options values too. (for ex: 3)
- You can use relative folder paths. If you use the input folder as the working directory, you don't need to use the input argument.

EXAMPLE USAGES:
- Photos located on all subfolders will be processed and their photograph's taken date and address information will be saved on CSV file using BigDataCloud reverse geocode provider.

Example with long argument names;
photo-cli info --all-folders --reverse-geocode OpenStreetMapFoundation --input [input-folder] --output [output-file].csv --openstreetmap-properties country city town suburb

Example with short argument names;
photo-cli info -a -e OpenStreetMapFoundation -i [input-folder] -o [output-file].csv -r country city town suburb

- Using Google Maps reverse geocode provider (need api key) with an option to prevent processing if there is no coordinate or no photo taken date found on any photo.

Example with long argument names;
photo-cli info --no-coordinate PreventProcess --reverse-geocode GoogleMaps --input [input-folder] --googlemaps-key google-api-key --googlemaps-types administrative_area_level_1 administrative_area_level_2 --output [output-file].csv --no-taken-date PreventProcess

Example with short argument names;
photo-cli info -c PreventProcess -e GoogleMaps -i [input-folder] -k google-api-key -m administrative_area_level_1 administrative_area_level_2 -o [output-file].csv -t PreventProcess
