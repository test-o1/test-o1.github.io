# How It's Done?

By extracting [Exchangeable image file format](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif) stored on each of your photographs.

## When

[Photograph's taken date](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif#Background) used to determine when photograph's date. Most of the camera/cell phones save this data without any setting.

## Where

[Photograph's coordinate data](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exif#Geolocation) is sent to selected third-party reverse geocode provider to [build a address](/docs/address-building-reverse-geocoding/intro).

Most of the cameras and cellphones have [GPS](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_Positioning_System) receiver on them. You need to be sure that on settings something like `Save GPS location` should
be enabled.
